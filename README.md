This is a small program made to quickly identify counter picks and input counter picks based on your matches
You can input your champion and the champion you were against and tell the program if you lost or not
You can then in the future input their champion and a list will show you the champions you lost with and won
You can also ask for statistics for that match up and see your highest winrate
You can input the patch number everytime you start the program to restart the stats
Previous patch version stats will still be in the files and will be accessible at a later verison
